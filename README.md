# ror-blog

This is a web blog created using the Ruby on Rails framework.
Two default users are created for demonstration purposes with the following credentials:

1)  email: admin@test.com
     password: admin

2)  email: user1@test.com
     password: user1

Authorization is also applied, so that each user can perform specific operations only on resources created by him, while limiting the scope of operations to resources created by other users.
